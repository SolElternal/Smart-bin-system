# Smart-bin-system
The Smart Bin System revolutionizes waste management by using sensors and IoT technology to detect waste levels, optimize collection schedules, and promote eco-friendly practices. It's a step towards smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable cities.
# Explain:
The project "Detects the amount of garbage in the bin and notifies the Website." aims to monitor the trash level in the bin by using an Infared Sensor, an effective device for measuring distance. The collected data is sent to Thingspeak, an IoT platform, where it is displayed in graphs and values on user-generated website pages. So that users can receive information about the amount of waste in the bin immediately and conveniently for example, cleaning the trash can in a timely manner or checking the trash level in the trash can to prevent it from filling up. The results are displayed on the website so that users can access information anywhere, anytime. And there is a notification via the internet when the trash level in the tank exceeds a pre-determined limit.
